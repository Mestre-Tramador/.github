# Support Resources

I hope to always provide support to all of my repositories, yet it seems that
this repository lack a specific set of resources regarding this topic. If you reached
this file while submitting an issue, please proceed, the documentation, or lack thereof,
was not useful to solve your inquire. If you so desire, try to direct contact me
in my social media, which you can check on my [readme][social-media].
