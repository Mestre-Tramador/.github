# Contributing Guidelines

I'm honored that you want to contribute with one of my projects! Unfortunately,
if you're reading this it probably means that there's no direct contribution guidelines,
which in turn leads here.

I'd ask for you to way until I decided the best take of actions for contributions,
but, of course, feel free to contact me with questions, ideas or anything on your
mind for a contribution. Consider submitting an issue as well, I've set templates
with complete forms for different topics so you can achieve your contribution goal
in a not so much direct way too.
